Description: IRTools provides advanced tools for analyzing and visualizing Item Response Theory 
    models and conducting Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis. It includes functions 
    for fitting IRT models, evaluating model fit and reliability, and performing detailed DIF 
    analysis with support for multiple group comparisons and data balancing using SMOTE. 
    Functions like 'evaluate_DRF' offer comprehensive analysis of uniform and non-uniform DIF 
    across groups, enhancing the utility of IRT in educational and psychological research.
